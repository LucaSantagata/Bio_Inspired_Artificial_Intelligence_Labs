# Bio_Inspired_Artificial_Intelligence_Labs
The objective of this course is the study of two of the main paradigms of bio-inspired artificial intelligence: evolutionary computation, inspired by evolutionary biology, and swarm intelligence, inspired by the collective behaviors of certain social animals. Firstly, the main theories will be introduced, and the key algorithms will be presented. Subsequently, it will be demonstrated how these techniques can be applied, for instance, to solve complex optimization problems, train data-based models, generate new content (such as video games, websites, art forms), identify software bugs, evolve programs, perform bug fixing, or find innovative solutions in fields like robotics, logistics, and engineering. Finally, it will be shown how these techniques can, in turn, aid in understanding certain biological systems, ideally bridging the connection between biology and artificial intelligence.

By the end of this course, students will have become familiar with the most important techniques of evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence. They will be able to apply these techniques in various contexts within industries, research, or even entertainment. Furthermore, they will have acquired the technical and theoretical foundations to develop new algorithms and apply them to new problems.
